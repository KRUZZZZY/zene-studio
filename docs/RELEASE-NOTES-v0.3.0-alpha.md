# Zene Studio 0.3.0-alpha — release notes (in progress)

**Status: DRAFT, not a release record.** There is no `v0.3.0-alpha` tag yet, and this file is opened by the
lane that added the first 0.3.0 feature rather than by the release lane. The 0.3.0 scope contract
(`NEXT-0.3.0-AGENT-PROMPT.md` §3.1, `V0.3-ALPHA-PLAN.md` §1) requires every feature that ships in 0.3.0 to
write its **UI absence** down in one line in the release notes *and* in `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md`. This draft
carries the entries each lane is obliged to add as it lands; the user-first rewrite of this file, the version
bump and the rest of the notes are wave **W12**'s deliverable.

Released before this one: **v0.1.0-alpha** (`docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.1.0-alpha.md`) and **v0.2.1-alpha**
(`docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.2.1-alpha.md`, the patch line that made the seven-platform matrix build and the
release claims true).

## The shape of 0.3.0

0.3.0 is an **engine-and-agent release, not a UI release**. Everything that can exist in the backend and be
driven through the control surface is folded in; the interface stays deliberately minimal. Stated as one line:

> **Everything is operable through `--control-socket` and the MCP bridge; almost nothing is operable from the
> interface.**

## Rack macros and key/velocity zones (`rack.*`) — added 2026-09-13

- **New: the rack has a command surface, and with it the two things #599 left out.** Before this, a rack could
  only exist in a project file that already contained a `<rack>` element — there was no way to build one at all.
  `rack.get_state`, `rack.add_chain`, `rack.remove_chain` and `rack.set_selected` now drive the chains and the
  chain selector, and each mutating call records its SPEC A16 reversibility class, its before-state and how it
  is reversed, so one `control.undo` takes the edit back.
- **New: macros.** A rack macro is a **named, persisted scalar (0..1) that drives existing parameters**, each
  through its own **range window**. `rack.macro_add` creates one, `rack.macro_target_add` binds a parameter
  (addressed as the rack chain, the `fx-<n>` device and the parameter's name, so a bind survives a reload), and
  `rack.macro_set` sets the value and writes every bound parameter in one step. The window is stated as a
  **fraction** of the parameter's own range, so one macro value moves a `-100..100` panning control and a
  `0..100` gain control by the same fraction of their ranges, and an inverted window (`high < low`) drives the
  other way. A parameter that no longer exists is **skipped and counted**, never guessed at; a target that
  names nothing is refused at bind time. `rack.macro_set` is one undo step covering the macro's own value *and*
  every parameter it wrote.
- **New: key and velocity zones.** `rack.zone_add` / `rack.zone_remove` store a **key range and a velocity
  range mapped to one of the rack's chains**, with an optional sample reference, and `rack.zone_resolve` answers
  which zone a note falls into — the first zone, in the order the zones were added, whose key range *and*
  velocity range both contain the note. A zone's ranges are the engine's own (`0..127` keys, `0..200`
  velocity, the note-velocity range `note.velocity_set` uses) and a zone that names a chain the rack does not
  have is refused rather than stored.
- **Both are saved under the existing `<rack>` element** inside the channel's `<mixerchannel>` — as `<macro>`
  and `<zone>` children, with no second container — and both survive a save/reload round trip. The format is
  additive: the element's version is now `2`, a version-1 reader ignores the new children, and a channel with
  no rack at all still writes no element.
- **Proof:** the registered ctest `RackMacrosTest` (docs/RACK-MACROS.md §5), which drives the window
  arithmetic against real `FloatModel` parameters, resolves the zone ranges, round-trips the whole
  configuration through the mixer's own save/load, exercises the group through the command registry including
  `control.undo`, and measures that configuring macros and zones leaves the rack's audio path allocating
  nothing.
- **UI absence — one line: rack macros and key/velocity zones are drivable through the socket, not from the
  interface.** There is no macro knob, no zone editor and no key map to draw; nothing in `src/gui/` creates,
  shows or moves either one. `docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` carries the same sentence.
- **And the zone half does not route yet, stated rather than implied.** The rack renders one stereo block and
  has no per-note input, so **no note path consults a zone in this build**: `rack.zone_resolve` reports which
  zone a note *would* fall into and nothing acts on that answer. What shipped is the persisted, validated,
  queryable zone model and its resolver. Closing the gap needs a per-note data path at the rack, not a control
  on this one — `docs/RACK-MACROS.md` §4.

## Not in this draft yet

The Session View, warp marker editing, comping, MPE modulation, Link sync, browser search, export dither/SRC
and the engine-gap items of the 0.3.0 scope, plus the release-bar statements, are the responsibility of their
own lanes and wave W12. This file grows as those land; it is not a summary of 0.3.0 and must not be read as one.
